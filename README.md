# Grad-CS-note

## Overview

This repository contains my personal review sheets for different computer science courses that I took at Texas A&M University. Notes are available but in handwriting format; I do not have any intention to digitalize them as of today. As I'm shifting towards taking notes through iPad+OneNote, hopefully lectures notes will be available sometime in the future.

The courses that have review sheets available so far include:

* CSCE 608, Database Systems. Semester took: Fall 2017. Instructor: [Jianer Chen](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/chen/)
* CSCE 614, Computer Architecture. Semester took: Fall 2017. Instructor: [Eun Jung (EJ) Kim](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/ejkim/)
* CSCE 629, Analysis of Algorithm. Semester took: Spring 2018. Instructor: [Sing-Hoi Sze](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/shsze/)
* CSCE 670, Information Storage and Retrieval. Semester took: Spring 2018. Instructor: [James Caverlee](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/)
* *More to come!*

I did take more courses other than those listed here, and I do have homework solutions for all courses. But for [academic integrity](https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules), I won't post them publicly here.

Hopefully I will include a detail guide here soon, but most of the notes I've uploaded are for midterm/final concepts.
